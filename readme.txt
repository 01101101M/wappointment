== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Can I customize the look and feel of the booking form?**

We provide a very simple editor in which you can change the texts, colors and few other parameters of each step of the booking process. We plan on adding several templates in the future, meanwhile simply use css to make it exactly the way you want.

**Can I set the duration of my appointment?**

Of course. You decide the duration of your appointments whether it's 5 minutes, 10 minutes, ..., 4 hours long. It's all up to you.

**Can I set a limit to when an appointment can be cancelled or rescheduled?**

You can set both values in hours from the settings page *Wappointment > Settings > General* 

**Why do reminders go out late sometimes?**

It depends on your website's configuration. The most reliable solution is to setup a cron task manually on your server(check your host's documentation) and disable WP cron (DISABLE_WP_CRON)

**Why is the booking form opening my schedule for the next 2months only?**

By default your schedule is opened for the next 60 days, but you can change that value in *Wappointment > Settings > General > Weekly Availability*. You decide which is the value your schedule should be made available for bookings, this said for performance reason we recommend keeping it as low as possible. Just figure what value is right for your activity.

**Why does nobody receive my confirmations or reminders emails?**

Your emails most likely go straight to SPAM or don't event reach your inbox. *Change the email sending method* in *Wappointment > Settings > Confirmations & Reminders* just go for the easy and reliable solution, [create a free account at SendGrid (100emails/day are free)](https://signup.sendgrid.com/) and configure Wappointment with the *SendGrid API*

**Can I sync multiple calendar besides of my Google calendar?**

Sure you can, we allow up to 4 calendars in the ics format to be synched from. It can be personal calendar(gmail, Outlook, iCal, etc..) or from external applications handling part of your schedule

**How often my Google calendar is being checked for sync?**

Every 5 minutes we download your calendar and check for changes, we don't do it more often as it could be a heavy task depending on how big is your calendar.

**I want my 25min appointments to start on the dot at 00 and 30, how can I do that?**

We've created a buffer time for that particular case, you can define it in the advanced settings. In your case, set your appointment's duration to 25min and set the buffer time to 5min this way each reservation will take a whole 30min in your availability.
